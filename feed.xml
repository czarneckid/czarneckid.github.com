        <title>Skipless</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;I only listen to music when I’m running inside on a treadmill. Usually I try and pick songs that I think will keep me motivated under fast pace conditions and heat.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The rules I’ve set for the “Skipless” playlist are simple:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Any song can go on the playlist&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;There is no limit to the number of songs on the playlist&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;You can choose any song from the playlist to start, but subsequent songs must be shuffled at random&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;If a song is skipped, it comes off the playlist at the end of the run and cannot be added back to the playlist for a month&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Try it. You’ll definitely think twice before hitting the button to skip a song.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Bye Bye Birdie</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;My last tweet was &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/CzarneckiD/status/796029697272512513&quot;&gt;November 8th, 2016&lt;/a&gt;, Election Day here in the United States. Prior to that, I can’t remember going more than a few days without a tweet or, at the very least, reading Twitter. But on that night, it seemed like the Twitter-verse wasn’t a space I wanted to be a part of. Was it the seemingly endless stream of tweets and retweets from people around the country and around the world, in and out of my network, telling the figurative “me”, the United States, the world, that we had elected the wrong candidate and how fucked we would all be? Kind of.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The next morning I woke up thinking, “A lot of people are going to be upset today”. But it wasn’t because of the election. It was because they didn’t have enough to eat, or a place to sleep, or adequate clothing for the coming winter, or whatever it was that had nothing to do with who was elected to the White House. After some quiet reflection at my desk, I sent off an e-mail to the local food bank to ask about volunteering. That starts today and for the forseeable future. I may change where I volunteer after a few months, but doing something is better than doing nothing to help someone.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Beyond that, I removed my Twitter client, Tweetbot, from my iPhone, work laptop, and home computer. In the past month, I haven’t looked or cared about Twitter, for many of the reasons above. Interspersed among all the politics, I’m sure I missed a lot about your lives, but I don’t think either of us noticed. I’ll get back on Twitter in spurts, but at the very least, no longer during work. Overall I think it’s a good change. Work is no longer punctuated or interrupted all the time by the sporadic @ mention notification or the blue Tweetbot icon at the top of my screen letting me know “New Tweets Are Available”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Going forward I’m going to work to focus my energies on things that really do have an impact on people’s day-to-day lives, like volunteering, and less on things that probably don’t, like Twittering.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>2015 Memorial Day Races Half Marathon</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;On Sunday, May 24th, 2015, I ran the &lt;a href=&quot;http://memorialdayraces.com&quot;&gt;Memorial Day Races&lt;/a&gt; Half Marathon. The race is held in Lenox, MA at the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.bso.org/&quot;&gt;Tanglewood&lt;/a&gt; music venue.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Race Venue&lt;/strong&gt;: It was easy enough finding the race entrance to Tanglewood in the AM. However, I expected there’d be some signage pointing runners to the start of the race. Waiting in line for the bathroom before the race, at least 2 people asked where the race started. I just followed the “crowd” down a paved path to the start of the race around 7:40 AM, but it’d be nice if the race organizers addressed that in future years. I say “crowd” because it’s not a large race in terms of runners. At least that oversight was unexpected given this was the 6th year of the races.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.albanyrunningexchange.org&quot;&gt;Albany Running Exchange&lt;/a&gt; was in charge of timing the race. They’re a fantastic local organization and there were no issues at all with timing of the race.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Race&lt;/strong&gt;: There were 206 finishers for the half marathon and 107 finishers for the marathon. Over the course of running the half marathon, there were a handful of runners I’d meet here and there, but it was largely a race without a lot of other runner or crowd contact. I do appreciate those runs where you’re able to lose yourself in the run and you can more fully appreciate the sights and sounds along the course. I did want to stop at one point towards the end of the run. There was a house that was obviously cooking breakfast as the smell of bacon wafted heavily over that part of the course.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately I threw out the printed course map for the half marathon which had the aid stations marked. I didn’t pay much attention to the aid stations along the course as I went out with my own nutrition/hydration. The course was sectioned off on the roads around the Berkshires with cones, but the roads were still open. However, the race is run on nearly all back roads that didn’t see much traffic in the early morning, so there weren’t many cars to worry about along the course. As I remember it, the most people that I saw on the course were when the course made its way through Stockbridge, MA and passing the Red Lion Inn. So, if you’re looking for a race with a lot of crowd support, this is not that race.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here’s the elevation chart with grades for the race.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/2015-memorial-day-races-elevation-and-grades.png&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It does get hilly in the last part of the race, but it wasn’t too terrible. At least &lt;strong&gt;I&lt;/strong&gt; enjoyed them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Most of the race is wooded country roads after you leave the Tanglewood venue. The view highlights for me were running through the Stockbridge, MA area, in particular the Stockbridge Golf Course and the town itself. There were a few golfers out at the time I ran by, but it was otherwise very peaceful to look over the golf course covered by hint of morning fog.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Nutrition/Hydration&lt;/strong&gt;: I had dinner the night before at &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.trattoria-vesuvio.com/Trattoria/Welcome.html&quot;&gt;Trattoria Il Vesuvio&lt;/a&gt;. I ordered the Zucchini Alla Parmigiana as my appetizer and the Penne Alla Vodka with a side of meatballs as my main course. I ended up tackling most of the penne and a few meatballs, but there was still a good amount of pasta that I took back to the hotel that night and ate the following day for dinner. For dessert I ordered the house made Tiramisu. Overall it was a good meal.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Before the race in the AM, I started with around 16 oz. of lemon-lime Gatorade Endurance. This has been a different approach to pre-race fueling and hydration that my running coach has started me on. I’m not entirely sold on it as it usually means I have to urinate frequently before the race. Typically I’d have knocked back a GU Energy gel 15 minutes before the start of the race. We’ll see if this approach continues.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I went out with my 2-bottle FuelBelt, using 2 10 oz. bottles. The hydration mixture was water and Nuun lemon-lime hydration tablets. I do remember slowing down at a water/Gatorade station around the 2nd mile on the course to try and see how the slow sip would work out, but I still find it too awkward to slow down and drink from a cup and run at the same time. Also, it feels too early in the race to have to slow down for water, as by then I’m settled into my pace for the race. Compared to other races, I think I was much better about pacing out my liquid intake, usually taking a sip or two every half-mile, and a few more after knocking back a GU. I went out with 3 GU Energy Gels, 2 Vanilla Bean and 1 Caramel Macchiato, and had one at miles 4 (Vanilla Bean), 8 (Caramel Macchiato), and 12 (Vanilla Bean).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After the race I had a recovery shake using a recipe that my running coach gave me (greek yogurt, almond breeze, water, almond butter, small banana, and ginger powder). It’s enough calories for me to get through my post-race stretching routine and a shower before getting out to breakfast.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Results&lt;/strong&gt;: My running coach had the following set out for me for this first “official” half marathon of 2015: “Start off first 3 miles conservatively then settle into half marathon pace of 8:20 min/mile. If you feel good then try to pick up the pace by 10 sec or more in the final 3 miles.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For the past two and a half months, I’ve been running with a Garmin watch. If you had asked me last year about wearing a Garmin, I’d have shot you a dirty look, but I’m 100% sold on it now (or really any device that’ll help you know your pace during a run). It’s definitely helped me to improve my running and pacing. I’m not sure I could’ve been as consistent as I was with my splits during this half marathon if I wasn’t wearing my Garmin. There was really no timing feedback along the course.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I ended up finishing with a time of 1:47:59 at an overall pace of 8:15 min/mi. As I’ve discussed with a lot of people when talking about this race: it wasn’t my fastest half marathon, it wasn’t my slowest half marathon, but I feel it was my most consistent half marathon. I ran nearly even splits the entire race, save for the few hills between miles 8 and 9 and 12 and 13. In those 2 sections, my pace was slower (around 8:40 min/mile), but compared to other half marathons with hills that I’ve run, I felt more comfortable in those sections. As with any training, it’s something I’ll be able to improve on going forward. And in the 2 miles before mile 12, I ran those at 8:02 min/mile and 8:01 min/mile, so I was happy to have some fuel for the final “fight” as my coach had set out.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Until the next race…&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Running, A Year Later</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;I started running in earnest in March 2014. Previous to that, I had run a few 5Ks locally, and that was sporadic at best over the years. Running really wasn’t in my weekly fitness routine before last year. I do go to the gym 4x a week and have for 14+ years now to keep in shape.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I decided that I was going to run a half marathon and registered for the Our Towne Bethlehem Half Marathon, which was run on May 17th, 2014. I picked a half marathon training program that fit nearly exactly into the time between March and May. I finished that race in 1:42:28. Having no expectations of what is a “good” or “bad” time, I thought I ran well. My body felt fine during and after the race. During 2014, I’d also go on to run 3 other official half marathons as well: Saratoga Springs Half Marathon, Vermont Maple Leaf Half Marathon and the Melanie O’Donnell Half Marathon where I ran a half marathon PR of 1:39:00.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In April of last year, I had also registered for the 2015 Walt Disney World Marathon. This was going to be my first marathon, however as I was training during 2014 for that marathon, I decided to register for the Mohawk Hudson River Marathon to test the marathon waters, so to speak. This was maybe a good and a bad thing. I adjusted my training routine to account for the Mohawk Hudson River Marathon and I ran that race in 3:39:34. Again, having no expectations of what is a “good” or “bad” time, I thought I ran well. I was running with the 3:35:00 pace group, but had to back off the last 4 miles as I felt my IT band in my left leg acting up and I didn’t want to injure myself.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I took a couple of weeks off after the Mohawk Hudson River Marathon to then start training for the Walt Disney World Marathon. It was aggressive, but I felt good in all my training leading up to the Walt Disney World Marathon. Until the week before … I was going to do some runs on Monday and Tuesday, but I started to feel my calf muscle in my left leg really bothering me. I’m not sure what it was that aggravated it, but I made the mental adjustment to simply enjoy the Walt Disney World Marathon and to run at a slower pace. I ended up running the Walt Disney World Marathon in 4:32:00. Certainly a slower pace and well off the time from my first marathon, but the calf muscle in my left leg that I thought would be my downfall, turned out to not hurt for the entire race. It would be my IT band in my left leg and my left heel/arch that really caused me to back off around mile 22. In retrospect, I probably should not have gone to the parks Friday and Saturday, which turned out to be around 9 and 10 miles of walking on those days. And I’m sure I needed more recovery time after the Mohawk Hudson River Marathon before starting training for the Walt Disney World Marathon.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My running goals for 2015 are simple, but aggressive: I want to run a marathon a season. I’ve already got the winter marathon behind me having run the Walt Disney World Marathon in January. For my spring marathon, I registered for the Sugarloaf Marathon in Maine, which will be run on Sunday, May 17th, 2015. That will be exactly a year since running my first half marathon and will be my third full marathon. As for the summer marathon, I was looking at the Sweltering Summer Ultra &amp;amp; Marathon, which will be run on Saturday, August 8, 2015 in Pittsfield, MA. This can also be run as an ultra marathon, so I was thinking it might be “fun” to do the 50K. And finally for my fall marathon, I’m again running the Mohawk Hudson River Marathon, which will be run on Sunday, October 11, 2015.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, I started working with a marathon coach in February of this year. I knew that if I were to go it alone, without a proper training plan that encompasses nutrition, running, cross training, and strength training, I might end up doing more harm than good. And I definitely do not want that to happen. I think my instincts with respect to training and nutrition are good, but I want to do it right and professional help is going to make the other 3 marathons happen this year without injury and without the flare ups that I’ve already experienced.&lt;/p&gt;
