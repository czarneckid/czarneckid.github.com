<p>So, about my choice for Game of the Year…</p>

<p>If you look at the blog posts on games I’ve played, and you can read back 13 years here,
I’ve averaged around 12+ AAA games a year. This year I’d classify the games as follows:
2 are full AAA releases, 1 is a AA release, 1 is a multiplayer-only live service game, and
1 is DLC.</p>

<p>A number of things changed my perspective on what games I invest my time in. In no particular
order, as they relate to Fortnite, here goes:</p>

<p>I’ve been playing Fortnite for almost 3 years now? In late 2021, while on vacation, my nephew asked
if I would start playing Fortnite with him so he could play in tournaments. It was a great way to
connect with him during COVID and to find out what was happening with my sister’s family since
they moved away in 2020. Mind you, this was before Fortnite released their Zero Build mode, so I
had to quickly learn the mechanics of building that he had at least a 2 year head start on. I wasn’t
terrible at it and hey, I was the first one of us to get a “20 bomb”, in builds no less.</p>

<p>It was different early on, where I was playing with more random groups, but I have found the Fortnite
community to be the least toxic in online gaming. I checked in-game and I’ve blocked 7 people and
those were all for using slurs in-game. This was all well before Fortnite’s voice and text chat
reporting mechanism.</p>

<p>My online gaming friends group are all heavily invested in Fortnite as their main game. No matter when
I boot up Fortnite, I usually have invites to party up with friends or friends are available for me to
invite. It’s one of very few games where I’ve regularly played with the same group of friends. And
it was only Fortnite where my friends group has remained committed for years now. On occasion, my
nephew and I have also roped my brother-in-law in to play Fortnite with us.</p>

<p>I am also keen on the direction Fortnite is taking in that it’s a launcher to be able to play
multiple types of games in the Fortnite “universe”. Battle Royale being the one mode I play, but
there’s Rocket Racing, LEGO Fortnite, Fortnite Festival, the countless games available in
Fortnite Creative, Fortnite Ballistic, etc. I’ve played some of each of the other modes, but
Battle Royale is my “bread and butter”, so to speak. I enjoy the cooperative/teamwork aspect
of that mode and use it to actively improve my personal communication skills.</p>

<p>I actively look forward to the daily Fortnite Item Shop rotation and I’m glad to see they have
extended that capability to the web where I can check and purchase items from the shop out of the
game itself. Recently I calculated how many Vbucks I’ve purchased in almost 3 years and it was
just over $1500. My latest commitment was to subscribe to Fortnite Crew where for $11.99/month,
I get 1000 Vbucks, the monthly Fortnite Crew pack, and access to all the battle passes across
the various game modes.</p>

<p>Finally, I’m better at Fortnite than when I started playing the game. I do appreciate that sites
like Fortnite Tracker are available, where I can get a detailed breakdown by season, mode, match
type (solo, duos, trios, squads), of my Fortnite statistics. And when I say I’m better than when I
started, I do mean objectively better. I’m currently in the Top 0.1% of players worldwide, for wins,
in Fortnite. Also, in case you’re wondering, I have roughly 3x as many wins as my nephew.</p>

<p>I might get around to games from 2024 like “Indiana Jones and the Great Circle” or DLCs like
“Elden Ring: Shadow of the Erdtree”, in the future. But if I’m being totally honest, a lot of games
in 2024 just didn’t excite me the way Fortnite continues to.</p>

<p>I realize this just reads like a list of things that anyone might like about Fortnite. But in
2024, the realization and combination of these things just jelled for me how much
I’m personally invested in Fortnite. Anyway, if you’ve read this far, I hope that puts some
more perspective on my 2024 Game of the Year.</p>
